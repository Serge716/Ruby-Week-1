# Logic
# 1) Represent a deck of 52 cards
 
# 2)  4 suites from low to high:
#       clubs
#       diamonds
#       hearts
#       spades

# 3)  card value:
#     1 to 10 = face value
#     J to K = 10
#     Ace = 1 or 11

# 4)  Dealer deals a card to the player and a facedown cards to self
# 5)  Dealer deals another card to player and a faceup card to self

# 6) Player evaluate card value
#     choose hit or stay
#     hit: player is given another card
#     stay: player card value is compared to dealer card
#     if player card value is higher tha dealer card
#       dealer deals another card to self

# 7)  player wins if vard value 21 or greater than dealer value
# 8)  player busts if card value is greater than 21
